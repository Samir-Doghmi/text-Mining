The projectâ€™s objective was to apply Text Mining techniques
to the Kaggle Fine Food Reviews dataset. After phases of
data cleaning, data exploration and text preprocessing there
follows a phase of then text representation. Subsequently, the
two main selected tasks are approached: classification based
on the score and topic modeling, using different models in both
cases for comparisons
